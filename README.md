# Florida Zika Outbreak Data
This is a repository meant to hold data and early analysis of the ongoing Zika outbreak in Florida. The data are being compiled as The Florida Department of Health continues to release Zika updates [here](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/all-articles.html). Feel free to use for whatever you'd like!

I have done my best to scrape the old reports to input the new cases, but there is room for improvement and discussion. For example, on August 25th there were 43 reported cases, August 26th there were 42 reported cases, and august 29th there were 43 again. I took this as 42 being a typo, and have just replaced it with 43, but it could also indicate that the initial 43 was incorrect.

Please feel free to send comments or suggestions to me, and append data to the current csv as you see fit! For example: it would be nice would be to add in a different csv that splits cases by their county of origin and by in-state versus out-of-state, but I haven't compiled those data yet.

# Disclaimer
I cannot guarantee the accuracy of these data as most of the case counts were entered by hand.
